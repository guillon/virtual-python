{"name":"Virtual-python","tagline":"Fork of the virtual-python script from easyinstall","body":"virtual-python script\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nSynopsys\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the virtual-python.py script originally authored by\r\nIan Bicking to simplify local pyton packages install.\r\n\r\nIt is useful for installing without specific privilege a local python\r\nenvironmant based on the python system wide install. On top of this\r\nenvironment new packages may be installed by standard python install tools\r\nsuch as setuptools and distribute, without side effect on the system wide\r\ninstall.\r\n\r\nThe script will install a new python executable that should be used in place\r\nof the system python.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSimply execute with the preferred prefix::\r\n\r\n    PREFIX=$HOME/virtual-python\r\n    python virtual-python.py --prefix=$PREFIX\r\n\r\nThis will install in `$PREFIX/bin/python` a new python binary that will point\r\nto the local python packages installed in the `$PREFIX/lib/python...`\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nThen simply use this python executable in place of the system installed\r\npython, for instance by putting it first in `PATH`::\r\n\r\n    PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH\r\n    python myscript.py\r\n\r\nRefer to the scripts for other available options.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nDownload the latest stable version directly from GitHub with::\r\n\r\n    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/virtual-python/master/virtual-python.py\r\n\r\nOr clone this repository with::\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/guillon/virtual-python\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense and Copyright\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe original script used had no license information and was downloaded from\r\nhttp://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py referenced from the\r\neasyinstall site\r\nhttp://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations.\r\n\r\nThe original author is apparently Ian Bicking as referenced in the script source.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed thus that the script can be redistributed, modified and\r\nrelicensed in full freedom and without any guarantee of any sort.\r\n\r\nNo specific license or copyright as been added on top of the original version.\r\n\r\nNote though that the script was modified to fix encountered issues, refer to the git\r\nhistory for contributors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
