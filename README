virtual-python script
=====================

Synopsys
--------

This repository contains the virtual-python.py script originally authored by
Ian Bicking to simplify local pyton packages install.

It is useful for installing without specific privilege a local python
environmant based on the python system wide install. On top of this
environment new packages may be installed by standard python install tools
such as setuptools and distribute, without side effect on the system wide
install.

The script will install a new python executable that should be used in place
of the system python.

Install
-------

Simply execute with the preferred prefix::

    PREFIX=$HOME/virtual-python
    python virtual-python.py --prefix=$PREFIX

This will install in `$PREFIX/bin/python` a new python binary that will point
to the local python packages installed in the `$PREFIX/lib/python...`
directory.

Then simply use this python executable in place of the system installed
python, for instance by putting it first in `PATH`::

    PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
    python myscript.py

Refer to the scripts for other available options.
